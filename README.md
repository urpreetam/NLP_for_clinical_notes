# NLP Pipeline 🚀

A basic Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipeline for text data processing and preparation. 📚

## Overview 🔍

The NLP Pipeline repository provides a step-by-step guide on how to preprocess raw text data for machine learning and deep learning algorithms. 🚀 It covers essential steps such as text cleaning, tokenization, normalization, stopword removal, POS tagging, feature extraction, and data splitting. 📋

## Pipeline Steps ⚙️

The NLP pipeline consists of the following steps:

1. 🧹 **Text Cleaning**: Remove unnecessary characters, symbols, and punctuation marks from the raw text data.

2. ✂️ **Tokenization**: Split the cleaned text into individual tokens or words.

3. 📏 **Normalization**: Standardize the tokens by reducing them to a common format using techniques like stemming or lemmatization.

4. 🚫 **Stopword Removal**: Eliminate common stopwords from the normalized text to reduce noise.

5. 🏷️ **POS Tagging**: Assign grammatical tags to each token, indicating its part-of-speech category.

6. 💡 **Feature Extraction**: Convert the tagged text into numerical feature vectors, such as BOW, TF-IDF, or word embeddings.

7. ⚖️ **Data Splitting**: Divide the preprocessed text data into training, validation, and testing sets for model training and evaluation.
